    content: `You do not need fancy or expensive foods to eat well in pregnancy. Your body needs enough energy and good nutrients.

**Good everyday foods (examples):**
• Rice or roti for energy
• Lentils (dal) for protein
• Eggs, fish, or small amounts of meat when possible
• Seasonal vegetables and fruits for vitamins
• Milk or yogurt if affordable

**Simple habits:**
• Eat small meals more often instead of one very heavy meal
• Drink plenty of clean water
• Limit oily, fried, very salty, and very sweet foods

**If you have very little food:**
• Try to combine rice/roti with lentils or an egg when you can
• Speak to a health worker about any nutrition programs in your area

**Reminder:**
Taking iron and folic acid as advised by a health worker is also part of "eating well."`
